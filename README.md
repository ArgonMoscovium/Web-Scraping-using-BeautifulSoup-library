# GitHub Topics Scraper

## Overview

This project is designed to scrape the most popular GitHub repositories for various topics listed on [GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics). The extracted data can be used for data analysis, machine learning, and other applications. The project demonstrates how to ethically scrape data from the web, taking care to respect rate limits and terms of service.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Extracts repository information such as names, descriptions, stars, forks, and URLs from GitHub Topics pages.
- **Data Storage:** Saves the scraped data in CSV format, with one file per topic.
- **Customizable:** You can easily modify the code to scrape other types of data or topics by changing the topic URLs.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.7+**
- **BeautifulSoup 4** for HTML parsing
- **Requests** for downloading web pages
- **Pandas** for handling CSV data

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Scraper

To run the script and start scraping, execute the Jupyter notebook or run the following Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python scrape_repos.py
```

This will scrape the top repositories for each topic listed on the [GitHub Topics page](https://github.com/topics) and save them as CSV files in the `data/` directory.

### Example

Here’s a sample workflow:

1. Scrape repositories for topics like 'Machine Learning', 'Web Development', etc.
2. Extract information such as stars, forks, and descriptions.
3. Save the data in a CSV file for each topic.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
├── data/                       # Folder containing CSV files for each topic
├── scrape_repos.py             # Main script to scrape GitHub repositories
├── Final.ipynb                 # Jupyter notebook for interactive scraping
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## Ethical Considerations

This project follows GitHub’s [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) by:
- Rate-limiting requests to avoid overloading GitHub's servers.
- Using publicly available data in a responsible manner.
  
Make sure to check the website’s terms before scraping.

## Future Work

1. **Data Analysis:** After gathering the data, it can be analyzed for trends, such as the growth of popular repositories.
2. **Time-Series Analysis:** Analyze the growth patterns of repositories related to specific topics.
3. **Data Aggregation:** Combine the scraped data into a single comprehensive dataset for deeper analysis.
4. **Automated Updates:** Set up periodic scraping jobs to keep the dataset updated.
